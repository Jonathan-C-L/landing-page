# My Landing Page
This is a living page that I will consistently update as I continue to progress as a programmer.
Currently this page only uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript (jQuery), but I have tried to set it up to emulate a full stack web application with a front-end and back-end section.
### About Me
The "About Me" section outlines where I currently am as a programmer and maybe some potential future endeavours I may pursue.
### Projects
The "Projects" section displays projects that I have worked on either in school or on my personal time.
This will contain a overall accumulation of all of the projects I have completed with links to the source code.
### Contact 
The "Contact" section will contact information and github link.
Both the phone number and email will be copied to the clipboard on-click.
